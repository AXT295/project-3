Data Visualisation Track

Our group proposal for Project 3 is plotting all the Ohio bridges on the map from all tewleve districts from the last decade. It will be done by taking the longitude and lattitude based off our dataset. We will create visualizations off the inventory and inspection data of those bridges. User will be able to filter data based off the districts.

Users will have the ability to toggle through the districts and check the bridge inventory and related inspection information can be visualized using this data.

We'll use JS and Leaflet to show bridges on the map and create filters.

Questions we're trying to answer are:

1. Total number of Bridges in 12 Ohio districts that were built 2012.
2. Latest inspection data on those bridges.
3. Visualize districts with maximum new bridges built over the last decade.
4. Visualize major bridges in each district, by calculating the bridges with 5 or more lanes on it.

Break down of task:
-Import datasets and clean datasets
-Determined which program would fit best with our datasets
-Load and store data in PostgresSQL
-Include user driven interaction(creating a district dropdown menu)
-Include visualisations(plotting bridges on the map)
-Summarization of the ethical practices of our data usage
